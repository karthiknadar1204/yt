# YT Chat: Chat with Your YouTube Videos

> **Note:** This project is still a work in progress. I built it during the duration of my finals, so there's a fair amount of ad-hoc code. Iâ€™m currently working on splitting the codebase into more modular components and fine-tuning the application for better performance and usability. **Contributions and feedback are welcome!**

**YT Chat** is a Next.js TypeScript application that allows users to interact with YouTube videos through a conversational interface. Powered by **Pinecone** for vector storage, **Grok LLM (via xAI)** for conversational AI, and **OpenAI embeddings** for semantic understanding, this app enables users to ask questions about video content and receive meaningful responses.
